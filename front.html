<h1>The idea
</h1>
<p>The idea behind this project was to picture rock paper scissor in a unique way and
I immedietly thought of the idea of  doing rock paper scissor in a fantasy game style.</p>
<h1>First draft
</h1>
<p>To the right you can see pictures of how the design started out.
The pictures contain lo-fi prototypes of the front page and game page.
The picture of the sky is a free image I downloaded.
<br>
If you're on a moblile, scroll down to the bottom to see the pictures.

<br>
<h1>The process
</h1>
<p>The final design was a lot different from the original idea.
 The reason for this was that I constantly was getting new ideas.
 <br>
 <br>
 Mid-project I decided to do a complete overhaul of the website using grid for the front page and flexbox for the game page which turned out pretty well.
 In the beginning I only thought of creating characters for the villain and the main character. Although I also decided to draw my own background and at the end I also implemented a "hidden" feature which reveals Jakks master.
 <br>
 <br>
I was going for a design which embodied the fantasy genre.
To achieve this I played around with a lot of different colors, instead of only doing black/white.
I also made the decision to make the website completely unique, which is why i drew everything myself.
</p>
<br>
<h1>How it turned out
</h1>
<p>The website turned out great. There are a lot of great features which I think gives this simple game more life.
 <br>
 <br>
 I had a hard time making the website responsive for mobile devices.
 In the end I decided to apply a different layout for devices with a width of 600px and below,
 which was thought to work for most smartphones.
