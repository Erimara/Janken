<h1>The idea
</h1>
<p>The idea behind this project was to picture rock paper scissor in a unique way and
I immedietly thought of the idea of  doing rock paper scissor in a fantasy game style.</p>
<h1>First draft
</h1>
<p>To the right you can see pictures of how the design started out.
The pictures contains design sketches of the front page, game page and game objects.
The picture of the sky is a reference-picture I used before drawing my own.
<br>
If you're on a smaller device and can't see the pictures, tilt your device.
</p>
<h1>The process
</h1>
<p>The final design was a lot different from the original idea.
 The reason for this was that I constantly was getting new ideas.
 <br>
 <br>
 Mid-project I decided to do a complete overhaul of the website using grid for the front page and flexbox for the game page which turned out pretty well.
 For character design I only thought of creating characters for the villain and the main character.
 Although I later decided to draw my own background and at the end I also implemented a "hidden" feature which reveals a new character.
 <br>
 <br>
I wanted a design which embodied the fantasy genre.
To achieve this I played around with a lot of different colors, and ultimitely landed on a whole mix of different compatible ones
To also make the website completely unique I decided to draw most things myself.
<br>
<br>
To make the website responsive I decided to apply three breakpoints at 1200px, 900px and 600px.
 These breakpoints makes it possible for most devices to use the website without any problems.
</p>
<h1>How it turned out
</h1>
<p>The website turned out great. There are a lot of great features which I think gives this simple game more life.
 <br>
 <br>
The website combines interaction, responsiveness and depth which makes it stand out.
